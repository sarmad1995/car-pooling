# iCarConnect
Car pooling app 
A car pooling app (ony front end), 
After you clone it, make sure you put your own config.js file with your theme and so on...
And you can also change your googleApi key inside Application.java and AppDelegate,
NOTE: I am still working on this app...And it won't work untill the server is running. So make sure you use your own backend.

config.js 
`export const GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR PLAY STORE KEY;
export const URL = 'BACKEND API';
export const DARK = '#265f82';
export const LIGHT = '#276B82';`
